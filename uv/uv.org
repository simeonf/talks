But opinions are my own!

** Confession Time

/Hi, my name is Simeon Franklin and I am a Pythonista./

** Confession Time

- I like 🦆 typing and I cannot lie
- I'm still not wild about types
- I do quote from the /Zen of Python/ (Long Live Tim Peters)
- There will probably be some Monty Python jokes

/Prologue/

** New Project, who dis?

In 2023 I joined a startup with a large mature Python/Django codebase.

Large Python codebases can be challenging but fortunately we were all
set up with tooling to enforce project coding standards.

** linting tools

Including but not limited to:

- mypy (type checking)
- bandit (security scanner)
- mccabe (complexity scanner)
- pep8 (formatting)
- isort (formatting)
- black (formatting)
- pylint (formatting & code smells)
- pyflakes (code smells)
- flake8 (pep8 formatting for pyflakes)

** Maturity is Good!

For every commit a variety of tools run to ensure code reviews don't
bikeshed over what line the parentheses goes on or how much whitespace
to put around the commas.

And also we detect a variety of bad code smells, potential security flaws, or un-pythonic code.

#+HTML: <p class="fragment large">🎉</p>

** Downsides

- Speed: It can take several minutes to check a commit!
- Complexity: A lot of tools and a lot of configuration files

#+HTML: <p class="fragment large">😞</p>

** Ruff

Sometime in 2023 I noticed folks on Twitter talking about a new linter *Ruff*.

It's written in Rust and it's supposed to be fast!

I ignored it. My project is mature and messing with linting is low on my priority list.

** Try it, Maybe You'll Like it!

At some point we had a hackathon and I tried adding Ruff to my pre-commit chain as a replacement for flake8 to see if I'd notice the speed difference.

** Huh

Ruff is also a drop-in replacement for black and isort and mccabe?

Ruff can replace pylint* and pyflakes too?

/See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/970 for Pylint compatibility status./

Oh yeah - and the speed claims?

** Speed

See https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/#testimonials

** Speed

Nick Schrock, founder of Elementl, co-creator of GraphQL:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Why is Ruff a gamechanger? Primarily because it is nearly 1000x
faster. Literally. Not a typo. On our largest module (dagster itself,
250k LOC) pylint takes about 2.5 minutes, parallelized across 4 cores
on my M1. Running ruff against our entire codebase takes .4 seconds.
#+END_QUOTE

** Speed

Bryan Van de Ven, co-creator of Bokeh, original author of Conda:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Ruff is ~150-200x faster than flake8 on my machine,
scanning the whole repo takes ~0.2s instead of ~20s. This is an
enormous quality of life improvement for local dev. It's fast enough
that I added it as an actual commit hook, which is terrific.
#+END_QUOTE

** Astral

Ruff is created by a company called Astral

https://docs.astral.sh/

Founder https://x.com/charliermarsh

** Ambitious

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 900px
[[file:./astral.png]]

** Is this ambitious?

Did Python really need another linter?

The speed gains are impressive!

And the extend and embrace attitude made a whole ecosystem of
separate tools and community plugins un-necessary..

** Rust & Speed

https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2023/02/ruff-python-linter-interview-with-charlie-marsh/

- speed is a feature
- js world building tooling in "not js" for speed and reliability
- esbuild (golang), bun (zig), swc (rust), etc.

Takeaway: High level language tooling should be written in lower level languages
languages for speed and ~rust~ is his weapon of choice.

** Philosophy

- In a mature language a single best-of-breed tool is better than an ecosystem of unix philosophy tools
- For example ~ruff~ might someday expand to typechecking as well (mypy, pyright, etc)

One fast tool for linting, autoformatting, typechecking? Yes please!

** Python Problems

What's wrong with Python?

#+ATTR_HTML: :style border: 0px
[[https://s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pythondotorg-assets/media/files/python-logo-only.svg]]

** Python Problems

What's wrong with Python?

- +significant whitespace+
- +weak (optional) type system+
- +slow runtime+

Shut up hater!

** Go away or I shall taunt you a second time!

[[file:./taunt.jpg]]

** Python Problems

What's wrong with Python?

- distribution
- runtimes and environments
- packaging and installation

** Python Problems

Even us fanboys have to admit: these are real problems that have
been... /solved/ by whole ecosystems of competing tools.

** Installing Python

That's a job for your OS!

Oh - don't install any packages into your OS-level python or you'll
break your OS!

** Installing Python

What if my CentOS comes with Python 3.7 and I want 3.11?

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 300px
[[file:./compile.png]]

If you aren't a Gentoo user this doesn't sound like a good time!

** Managing Dependencies

~pip install -r requirements.txt~ right?

Oh you want completely reproducible builds of your Python project. No problem - just use one of:

** Managing Dependencies

- pip-tools
- pipenv
- poetry
- pdm (poetry but better)
- pipx (maybe you want to install an executable?)

Oh and don't forget to add ~pyenv~ for the Python version management even if you use something else for dependencies.

** Not to mention publishing packages

Do I need ~hatchling~? And ~twine~?

#+HTML: <p class="fragment large"><img src="https://i.imgflip.com/9hnn3d.jpg"></p>


** Javascript folks: So?

I know the javascript folks are not impressed but take it from me -
this proliferation of tools is complexity and pain.

** tl;dr

I could keep ranting at length but let's take a thought exercise:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I have this cool script I found that's 30 lines of code and
it uses a couple of scientific libraries. But when I save it and run
it I get "ModuleNotFound: no module named scipy" error. How do I run it?

-- A beginner
#+END_QUOTE

** Possible conversations

- Do you know what a virtualenv is?
- Make one of those, activate it, and run ~pip install scipy~. /Yes, from the command line./
- Your system python doesn't ship with ~pip~ huh...
- Have you ever heard of Anaconda Python? You're going to need to edit your system path...

** This is pain

Packaging, requirements, distribution...

Coincidentally /stuff that was considered outside core Python historically./

You may remember the long saga of ~easy_install~, ~distutils~, ~setuptools~, the bad old days of .eggs, etc.

** uv

Oh yeah - I was going to talk about ~uv~!

In 2024 I found out Charlie Marsh and the folks at Astral were working on ~uv~.

** uv

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 800px
[[file:./uv.png]]

** deja vu

Ok, I get fast is kind of your thing, Charlie. But ~pip install~ is fast enough for me...

And do we really need yet another package manager? At least its not called ~yapip~.

*[Insert relevant xkcd here]*

** Yes!

And I really need to stop underestimating astral and Charlie Marsh.

** Features

Speed. /Duh/

Now that you mention it, updating a library in my dependencies takes
10 minutes to produce a new set of pinned transitive dependencies
using ~pip-compile~.

** Transitive Dependencies

Will it build?

/requirements.txt/
#+BEGIN_SRC
a==1.0
c>=5.0
#+END_SRC

I don't see why not...

** Transitive Dependencies

Resolve to find out... Don't forget to account for OS and version markers!

#+BEGIN_HTML
 <script type="module">
    import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@11/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs';
    mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: true });
  </script>
<pre class="mermaid" style="width:400px;">
flowchart TD
    a[a==1.0] --> b[b==2.x]
    a --> d[c==5.x]
    b --> c[c==4.x]
</pre>
#+END_HTML

https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/resolution/#basic-examples

** Speed

This can take a while with a real world project with hundreds of
direct dependencies and thousands of transitive dependencies.

~uv~ is orders of magnitude faster at this as well as orders of
magnitude faster at actually installing dependencies.

** Embrace & Replace

Great - I suppose I have to learn a new config and new project workflow?

Nope. ~uv~ is a drop-in replacement for ~pip~, ~pipx~, ~pip-tools~, ~virtualenv~, etc.

** Embrace & Replace

I updated my workflow from

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ pip-compile
$ pip install -r
#+END_SRC

to
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ uv pip compile
$ uv pip install -r
#+END_SRC

#+HTML: <p class="fragment large" style="color:red;">❤</p>

** That was easy

But is speed the only benefit of uv?

** Distribution hurts less

Demo time:

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ uvx --python 3.12 textual-demo
#+END_SRC

#+HTML: <p class="fragment"><em>Seriously - do this now.</em> </p>

** Tool Management

~uv~ is a ~pipsi~ / ~pipx~ replacement.

Use ~uv tool run~ (or ~uvx~) which will download and install tools and run them.

Installs to a virtualenv, auto ~$PATH~ managment, can specify what version of Python to use, etc.

** Tool Management

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ uvx rich-cli

** Python Management

See https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
# Or as needed
$ uv run --python 3.8 example.py
#+END_SRC

and remember - ~pyenv~ builds python from source. It does not take 3s!


** Virtualenv

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
$ uv pip install foobar  # installs in .venv
$ uv run myscript.py     # runs in virtualenv
#+END_SRC

** Project Management

- ~uv init~ - .venv, pyproject.toml, .python-version, uv.lock
- ~uv add~ - install, add to deps in pyproject, update lockfile
- ~uv lock --upgrade-package~ - update only specified packages if possible

** Script Dependencies

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ uv run --with flask example.py
#+END_SRC

https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/

** Inline Script Dependencies

See https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/inline-script-metadata/#inline-script-metadata

My script - https://gist.github.com/simeonf/db61cfed74b75da6a17f92ad16afe649

** Inline Script Dependencies

Demo:

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ uv run https://gist.githubusercontent.com/simeonf/db61cfed74b75da6a17f92ad16afe649/raw/c563660afede009bb58bf52f6ed553c62093e479/example.py
#+END_SRC

** And much more

Out of time to cover:

- ~uv build~ and ~uv publish~
- workspaces (stolen from rust's Cargo)
- ~uv tree~ (replace ~pipdeptree~ / ~pipenv graph~ etc)
- ~uv cache~ (manage your resolution cache with an eye towards GitHub Actions/CircleCi)

** Lessons Learned

- Astral and Charlie Marsh are two for two!
- Speed is a feature
  - saving me CircleCI $$$ and developer attention
- Theme: One integrated tool replaces an ecosystem of competing tools
- Addressing Python pain points: packaging, requirements, distribution... all got a lot better in 2024

** Gratitude

My title is clickbait - but I do actually feel a lot less pain due to Charlie Marsh (and Rust I guess!)
